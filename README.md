| [TASK 1](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-intro.md) | Git and GitHub | Good tool for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work with people. <ul><li>First of all introduce yourself to Git ```$ git config --global user.name```</li> <li> Create your repository ```$ git init``` and manage your files ```$ git add file.txt```</li> <li> Look after your files ```$ git status/log/diff/show``` Also be familiar with ```.git``` file</li> <li> Record your changes with  ```$ git commit```</li> <li> Mistakes happen, keep calm and ```$ git reset/rm/revert```</li> <li>Separate your workflow with ```$ git branch``` and ```$ git rebase``` The relation of branches can be shown by ```$ git log --oneline --decorate --graph --all```. If you get lost, you can always be found with ```$ git checkout master```</li></ul> | version control system |[:camera:](task_git_intro/README.md)|

| [TASK 2](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/linux-cli-http.md) | Linux, Command Line, HTTP Tools | Linux is case-sensitive! <ul>Useful commands to <li>list the contents of your current directory ```$ li```</li><li>create a directory ```$ mkdir```</li><li>remove an empty directory ```$ rmdir```</li><li>rename file/to move a file ```$ mv```</li><li>change directories ```$ cd```</li><li>show where you are in the directory structure ```$ pwd```</li><li>display the contents of a file ```$ more```</li><li>copy file ```$ cp```</li><li>remove the file ```$ rm```</li><li>change mode of file (rwx) ```$ chmod```</li><li>see a disk usage listing ```$ df```</li><li>list all processes ```$ps aux```</li><li>kill the process ```$ kill ID-process```</li></ul> NOTE!<br> [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177) <br> [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know - Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)| operation system |[:camera:](task_linux_cli/README.md)  | operation system |[:camera:](#) |

| [TASK 3](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/git-collaboration.md) | Git for Team Collaboration | Important thing - to collaborate with others developers using Github. And the remote repository is the solution! So in collaborating you need to create a new branch that has a descriptive name that describes what changes it contains. To manage your remote repo use commands ```$ git remote```, to send changes us ```$ git push``` and to to retrieve ```$ git fetch/pull ``` <ul>----->The git push command takes :<li>the shortname of the remote repository you want to send commits to </li> <li>the name of the branch that has the commits you want to send</li></ul><ul>----->When git pull is run, the following things happen : <li>the commit(s) on the remote branch are copied to the local repository</li> <li>the local tracking branch (origin/master) is moved to point to the most recent commit</li> <li>the local tracking branch (origin/master) is merged into the local branch (master)</li></ul> <ul>-----> When git fetch is run, the following things happen : <li>he commit(s) on the remote branch are copied to the local repository</li><li>the local tracking branch (e.g. origin/master) is moved to point to the most recent commit</li></ul>| web hosting service |[:camera:](task_git_collaboration/README.md) |

| [TASK 4](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/master/tasks/html-css-intro.md) | Intro to HTML and CSS | Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.  HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically with HTML tags ```<tag></tag>```, brick by brick. <br>---> I can always refer to [MDN references](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element) to get unstuck (as needed)<br><ul> <li><strong>HTML5</strong> &#8211; HTML5 and it&#8217;s new elements make for the most beautiful HTML yet.</li> <li><strong>DOCTYPE</strong> &#8211; HTML5 has the best DOCTYPE ever</li> <li><strong>Indentation</strong> &#8211; Code is indented to show parent/child relationships and emphasize hierarchy.</li> <li><strong>Charset</strong> &#8211; Declared as first thing in the head, before any content.</li> <li><strong>Title</strong> &#8211; Title of the site is simple and clean. Purpose of page is first, a separator is used, and ends with title of the site.</li> <li><strong>Body</strong> &#8211; ID applied to body to allow for unique page styling without any additional markup.</li> <li><strong>File Paths</strong> &#8211; Site resources use relative file paths for efficiency. Content file paths are absolute, assuming content is syndicated.</li> <li><strong>Image Attributes</strong> &#8211; Images include alternate text, mostly for visually impaired uses but also for validation. Height and width applied for rendering efficiency.</li> <li><strong>Main Content First</strong> &#8211; The main content of the page comes after basic identity and navigation but before any ancillary content like sidebar material.</li> <li><strong>Appropriate Descriptive Block-Level Elements</strong> &#8211; Header, Nav, Section, Article, Aside&#8230; all appropriately describe the content they contain better than the divs of old.</li> <li><strong>Hierarchy</strong> &#8211; Title tags are reserved for real content, and follow a clear hierarchy.</li> <li><strong>Appropriate Descriptive Tags</strong> &#8211; Lists are marked up as lists, depending on the needs of the list: unordered, ordered, and the underused definition list.</li> <li><strong>Common Content Included</strong> &#8211; Things common across multiple pages are inserted via server side includes (via whatever method, language, or CMS that works for you)</li> <li><strong>Semantic Classes</strong> &#8211; Beyond appropriate element names, classes and IDs are semantic: they describe without specifying. (e.g. &#8220;col&#8221; is much better than &#8220;left&#8221;)</li> <li><strong>Classes</strong> &#8211; Are used any time similar styling needs to be applied to multiple elements.</li> <li><strong>IDs</strong> &#8211; Are used any time an element appears only once on the page and cannot be targeted reasonably any other way. </li> <li><strong>Dynamic Elements</strong> &#8211; Things that need to be dynamic, are dynamic.</li> <li><strong>Characters Encoded</strong> &#8211; If it&#8217;s a special character, it&#8217;s encoded.</li> <li><strong>Free From Styling</strong> &#8211; Nothing on the page applies styling or even implies what the styling might be. Everything on the page is either a required site resource, content, or describing content.</li> <li><strong>Comments</strong> &#8211; Comments are included for things that may not be immediately obvious upon reviewing the code.</li> <li><strong>Valid</strong> &#8211; The code should adhere to W3C guidelines. Tags are closed, required attributes used, nothing deprecated, etc.</li> </ul><br> Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.<br> ```selector {```<br>```property : value;```<br>```}```<br> ---> For any info about CSS [Mozilla Developer Network - CSS Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference)| markdown |[:camera:](task_html_css_intro/README.md)|
